## Roadmap

- Create client
    - react project with routes and boilerplate pages

- Create server
    - express project with routing, with placeholder 200 responses

- Create migrations

- Gather 10 sample input strings of musical notes (e.g., ["C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "A", "B", "C#", "D#", "F#"])

- Create seeds with sample exercise data

- Deploy client and server projects so all commits will be reflected in production

- Feature: Home page
    - Implement list caf√©s page including location form
    - Store given location in sessionStorage
    - Create GET /cafes endpoint

- Feature: Game Page
    - Colored Tiles: The tiles on the wall are color-coded according to the string of musical notes for each exercise.

    - Side Panel with Musical Notes: There is a side panel displaying all 12 musical notes. Each note is represented by a visually distinct tile and a clear label indicating the note name (e.g., C, D, E, etc.). Clicking on a note plays the corresponding audio reference, aiding users in learning the correct pitches.

    - Singing Interaction: The monster jumps to the corresponding tile if the note is sung correctly. If a user sings an incorrect note, The corresponding tile will blink, indicating the mistake.

    - End of Exercise: Once all notes are sung correctly, two options are presented, "Return to the home page" and "Play the exercise again" ensuring a smooth transition back to the home page or a reset of the game state for replaying.

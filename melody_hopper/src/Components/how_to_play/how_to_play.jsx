                <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Help the monster jump across the tiles by singing the notes in the correct order!</p>

                <p><strong>Starting the Game</strong>: Begin by selecting the exercise. The tiles representing the notes will be displayed on the screen.</p>

                <p><strong>Singing the Notes</strong>: Sing the notes displayed accurately. The monster will jump to the next tile only if you sing the correct note in the specified order.</p>

                <p><strong>Tile Reference</strong>: If youâ€™re unsure about how a note sounds, use the side panel. It contains tiles that provide audio references for each note. Click on a note in the side panel to hear it before you sing!</p>

                <p><strong>Identifying Wrong Notes</strong>: If you sing the wrong note, the corresponding tile will start blinking. Try to correct your pitch and sing the right note to keep the game moving!</p>

                <p><strong>Have Fun!</strong> Enjoy the challenge and keep practicing to improve your pitch accuracy!</p>
